## Introduction

This is a pure PHP realization of the **GraphQL** protocol based on the 
[youshido/graphql](https://github.com/Youshido/GraphQL) and/or 
[webonyx/graphql-php](https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php#fields) 
implementations of the official GraphQL Specification 
located on [Facebook GitHub](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/).

The difference from the above implementations is that the Railt provides the 
ability to describe the types and extended control of their behavior, 
thereby solving problems such as:

- Simplifying type declarations
- Types reusage
- Significant simplification of the construction of the API
- More flexible integration with frameworks (e.g. 
[Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/framework) or [Symfony](https://github.com/symfony/symfony))
- And others
