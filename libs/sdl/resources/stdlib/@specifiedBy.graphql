The @specifiedBy built-in directive is used within the type system definition
language to provide a _scalar specification_ URL for specifying the behavior of
[custom scalar types](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Scalars.Custom-Scalars).
The URL should point to a human-readable specification of the data format,
serialization, and coercion rules. It must not appear on built-in scalar types.
